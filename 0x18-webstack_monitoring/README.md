## Context

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the tech industry. 
In the age of data-ism, monitoring how our software systems perform is essential. 
This project focuses on implementing tools to measure the performance and status of servers.

Web stack monitoring is typically broken down into two categories:

- **Application Monitoring**: Collecting data about your running software to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Server Monitoring**: Collecting data about your virtual or physical servers to ensure they are not overloaded (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, or network overload).

- **Why monitoring is needed**
- **The two main areas of monitoring**
- **Access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)**
- **Error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)**

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing web stack monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of software systems. This project serves as an introduction to the essential concepts and practices of monitoring.
