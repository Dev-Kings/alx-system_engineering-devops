# API Practice and Interview Preparation

Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, and other times they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There are many endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews, and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

## Resources
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

### General concepts covered
- Reading API documentation to find the endpoints.
- Using an API with pagination.
- Parsing JSON results from an API.
- Making a recursive API call.
- Sorting a dictionary by value.
